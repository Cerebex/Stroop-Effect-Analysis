# Stroop Effect Analysis
* This is a project I completed on Udacity to Analyzed the Stroop effect using descriptive statistics to provide an 
	intuition about the data, and inferential statistics to draw a conclusion based on the results.
* Please review my [Report](/Stroop_Effect_Test.pdf), [Dataset](/stroopdata.csv) and 
	[Python code](/Histograms_Numbers.py).
